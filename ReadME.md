# Automated Testing for E-Commerce Mobile App Guest Checkout Feature
## Project Description
This project focuses on automating the testing of the guest checkout feature in an e-commerce mobile application. The primary scenarios covered include a customer adding products to their shopping cart and successfully placing an order as a guest user. The testing is conducted using the Appium framework, a widely-used tool for automating mobile application testing on Android platforms.

Key Features Tested
Adding Products to Cart: The automated scripts simulate a customer browsing through the app, selecting products, and adding them to the shopping cart.

Guest Checkout: The scripts emulate the checkout process as a guest user, including entering shipping details, selecting shipping options, providing payment information, and completing the order placement.

Tools and Frameworks Used
Appium: Appium is used as the primary automation framework for testing the e-commerce mobile application on Android devices. It provides support for automating UI interactions and simulating user actions.
Project Structure
Test Scripts: Contains the automated test scripts written using the Appium framework and programming languages such as Java, Python, or JavaScript.

Test Data: Includes test data such as product information, shipping addresses, and payment details used in the test scenarios.

Page Objects: Organizes mobile app screens and elements into reusable components to improve code maintainability and readability.

Test Reports: Stores generated test reports, including logs and screenshots, for documentation and analysis.

How to Run Automated Tests
Setup Testing Environment: Install and configure the necessary tools and dependencies for mobile automation testing, including Appium server, Android SDK, and required drivers.

Write Test Scripts: Develop automated test scripts using the Appium framework and your preferred programming language, incorporating appropriate assertions and validations for each step of the guest checkout process.

Configure Test Data: Define test data inputs, including product selections, shipping addresses, and payment details, to be used during test execution.

Execute Tests: Run the automated test scripts against the e-commerce mobile app using Appium, either locally or in a continuous integration (CI) environment.

Analyze Results: Review test reports, logs, and screenshots generated during test execution to identify any failures or issues encountered during the guest checkout process.

Debug and Maintain: Debug failed tests, update test scripts as needed to accommodate changes in the mobile app, and continuously enhance test coverage and reliability.
